Solving the electrical capacitance tomography forward problem for a circular sensor using the Wolfram Language in Mathematica.//
The notebook contains comments which should help explain everything. The dimensional units are assumed to be in millimeters for all of the calculations. To save computational time, a Rienmann sum approach was taken instead of the usual numerical integration to find the sensitivity maps for each electrode pair.
